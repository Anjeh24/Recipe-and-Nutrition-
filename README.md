As a group we made an application  for people that have specific diets but want to find delicious recipes that are easy to make.

When deploying the application: 

* As a USER I should be presented with a landing page that has a few demo recipes and a list of different diets

* As a USER I want to be able to find my specific diet

* THEN I should be able to click that diet

* THEN I should be able to filter and view different recipes that are specific to the diet that I have chosen
